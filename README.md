# Isotope SDK

The Isotope software development kit (SDK) is for interfacing with the Isotope Breakout board, which provides various I/O ports and functionalities such as stepper motor control, analogue input, PWM output and temperature sensor input.

# Packages

### isotope
isotope is the package for handling communication with the Isotope Breakout board. It provides easy to use APIs for sending commands and retrieving data from the I/O ports on the board. 

### unit2_controller
unit2_controller is the package for controlling Unit 2. It provides high level methods to control solenoid valves and diaphragm pumps. It is also an excellent example of inteferacing with multiple Isotope Breakout Boards.
